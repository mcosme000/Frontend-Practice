# Frontend-Practice


■ ABOUT THIS PROJECT<br />
This is a personal project to practice frontend concepts and gain confidence. 
Basically I choose some web pages I like and try to recreate them but changing 
the concept, design and other elements. 


■ INSPIRATION AND RESOURCES<br />
I am using "Frontend Practice" and "Frontend Mentor" pages. 
They offer a good selection of web pages for developers to recreate. 


■ PROJECT GOALS<br />
Keep learning and develope some skills!


■ CONTENTS
01. Ableton about page (Frontend Practice - Easy)
    This project includes practice with grids layout, something that I don't usually use. 
    Instead of copying the whole page, I changed the contect to make it about a Coffee Shop about page! 
    I made the logo myself and took the photos from Pexels.
